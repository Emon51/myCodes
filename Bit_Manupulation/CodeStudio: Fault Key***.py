Problem statement
Ninja is trying to write a function that takes two integers and returns their sum. But, due to some faults in his keyboard, he can not use the “+”, operator, which means he is not able to simply return ‘A’ + ‘B’, where ‘A’ and 'B' are the numbers to be added. You need to help Ninja in finding the sum of two numbers without using the "+" operator anywhere in your code.

Note:
 You should also not use the increment "++" operator too.
For example :
You are given A = 4, B = 6, their sum = 10, you need to return 10.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
-10000 <= A, B <= 10000

where ‘T’ is the number of test cases and ‘A’ and ‘B’ are the two integers.

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
1 1
4 6
Sample Output 1:
2
10
Explanation of sample input 1:
In the first test case, 
Sum of the two numbers = 1 + 1 = 2. 

In the second test case, 
Sum of the two numbers = 4 + 6 = 10.
Sample Input 2:
2
-1 1
0 1
Sample Output 2:
0
1
Explanation of sample input 1:
In the first test case, 
Sum of the two numbers = (-1) + 1 = 0.

In the second test case, 
Sum of the two numbers = 0 + 1 = 1.
